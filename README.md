Cards Against Humanity (in Toki Pona)

This is a partial translation of the Cards Against Humanity games' base cards. The base game cards are licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA 2.0 license and can be downloaded at their website: https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/
And so the translation in cah.js is also licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA 2.0 license.

The rest of the code is free. I made this so that people can play the game remotely. It won't sync with other people's games like fancier versions will, this essentially only distributes cards to one player. To better share it quickly, I added a download button, because how easy it is to make a screenshot ranges across devices.
